# Course Description

Students will examine network-based threats whether originating from the Internet or the local LAN, and learn about ways to protect, detect, and defend the enterprise network from such attacks. The relationship between user network policy and securing the network will also be explored. Students will participate in hands-on experiments and demonstrate their understanding of subject matter via projects and presentations

- Introduction to Information Security, Security Policies and Standards

**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**

As a learning community, we should be working together to create a compelling and respectful space; an environment that is safe and accepting, where everyone feels like they can bring their whole self to the table; a classroom that supports the ever-changing and diverse learning needs and complexities of Champlain College students; a space that maximizes learning for everyone. Differences of opinion are encouraged and should be nurtured. Discussions themselves are collaborative learning ventures, and it is often through dialogue that we come to understand our thoughts and positions.

We all co-create this positive, inclusive learning environment. The following are guiding principles for how this can be achieved:

‚Ä¢ Appreciate that everyone is in a different ‚Äúspace‚Äù of learning: how they learn, different skill levels, and the unique personal context 
they bring to the classroom. Each of us in this class will know more in some areas and less in others.  
‚Ä¢ Try not to make assumptions; ask questions to learn more about other perspectives, especially those different from your own.  
‚Ä¢ Lead with ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù when you listen to others‚Äô perspectives and prioritize kindness over proving the other wrong. Listen to learn first, rather than to judge or ‚Äúwin immediately.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Respect others‚Äô perspectives and recognize your biases and the limits of your knowledge.  
‚Ä¢ Show respect for others as individuals by learning and using their preferred names and affirming pronouns.  
‚Ä¢ Share your knowledge and skills with tact.  
‚Ä¢ Applaud each other‚Äôs efforts and offer constructive feedback when possible.  
‚Ä¢ Respect the speaker, even when you do not agree with or support the point the speaker is making.  
‚Ä¢ Do not monopolize the conversation; give others a chance to contribute.  
‚Ä¢ Realize that no opinion or position is out of bounds (bar hate speech), but all ideas should be articulated with thoughtfulness and humility.  
‚Ä¢ Take into consideration the impact of your words on others.  
‚Ä¢ Racial, ethnic, gender, or other identity-based slurs are nothing other than hurtful and will not be tolerated.

# Prerequisites

SEC-250, NET-215, and NET-255 with a grade of C or better

# Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1. The student will be able to segment, defend and establish visibility over an enterprise network.
2. The student will be able to configure network security devices such 
   as network firewalls in order to segment a network and enforce network 
   security policies.
3. The student will be able to research, design and deploy a logging 
   infrastructure in order to gain visibility into enterprise security 
   events.
4. The student will be able to correlate and analyze network security 
   events in the context of a security information and event management 
   tool
5. The student will be able to deploy network proxy servers in order to gain visibility on network traffic
6. The student will be able to research, integrate and deploy network 
   intrusion detection tools to complement a logging infrastructure
7. The student will be able to research, duplicate and mitigate common network security vulnerabilities.
8. The student will be able to design and deploy secure remote access 
   solutions to include site-to-site and remote access use cases.

# Instructional Approach

This course is comprised of the following instructional approaches:¬†

# Lectures

Lectures will be brief and will be used to present content and help convey important concepts, facts, and facilitate the integration of these into understanding. They will also be used to relate the content to lab and project activities.

# Labs

This is a hands-on course, and labs are a major learning component. Student participation in labs is critical, both for their learning and for the group. A good portion of class time will be spent configuring equipment, systems, and applications to reach a particular goal or set of goals outlined in the day‚Äôs scenario. While the instructor is always available to guide design, configuration, and troubleshooting, students are expected to be active in their approach to solving lab scenarios. Participation should not be limited to following directions and giving up when things don't work.

# Assignments

Students will be given homework assignments that cover material presented in class and in the assigned readings. These assignments will be submitted in written form.

# Tests and Quizzes

Students will be given exams and quizzes that may test their theoretical understanding of the course topics.

# Grading

Grades will be awarded in accordance with the Champlain College Grading System for undergraduate students. Final Grade Breakdown can be viewed in Canvas and is subject to change with notification.

Final grades will be determined based on the following components:

- Labs: 50%
- Assignments: 20%
- Assessment: 15%
- Applied Research Project: 15%

# Course Policies

**Assignments/Homework/Labs/Class Activities**

Assignments will be given based on material presented in class, labs, and current events. ***Late work will have 5% per day deducted for ten days.*** After that, no credit will be given for the assignment. If there is no due date for a lab or class activity, students presume a due date during that period/before the next one. Like industry, you must work outside of class to complete activities and labs.¬†  
***Please be advised that the deadline for submitting assignments is strictly set for
 11:59 PM on Sunday night of the respective week.***

# Attendance and Participation

Students are expected to attend all classes. Not doing so will likely jeopardize a student's academic success. Suppose extreme illness, accident, or similar circumstances make attending a class impossible. In that case, you are still responsible for covering the material and making up the work before the next class. ***Waiting until the next class to discover what was covered will not work.*** You are solely responsible for obtaining and completing the assignment, just like in the industry. The information and content will be available on CANVAS, and you can contact me with anything you need help with.

If you contribute to the class, you will gain participation points. Participation includes paying attention during class, engaging in discussion and lab activities, showing up on time and staying for the entire class period, submitting assignments on time, and following up on topics that interest you. Normal participation will be awarded an 
average grade.

Activities considered to impact participation negatively include consistently arriving late, using a phone/computer/other electronic device during class for non-related activities that may disrupt fellow students' learning environment, leaving the classroom excessively, engaging in conversations not related to content, not participating with
 group-based activities, etc.

As attendance is associated with participation, a student‚Äôs grade may suffer from excessive absences. If a student has more than 1 week's unexcused absences, 2% of the final grade will be deducted for each absence thereafter.

Make-up quizzes will only be allowed with prior communication between you and me before the quiz. This means that you have contacted me, notifying me of your circumstances and reason for not being able to take the quiz/test, and we have discussed the possibility of a makeup. 
Simply missing that day and expecting to take a makeup at your discretion is not an option. The industry has due dates, and so does this class.
